# A month with the Moonlander

So it has been a month already. Many things have changed since then, the main one being that I learned how to use a keyboard after... IDK... 18 years or something like that?

This is going to be an overview of what happened, what I learned and what I still have to do.

## A quick review of the month

I was at awe when I unpacked the Moonlander. It looked otherworldly. Being split made it a bit weird at first, but that wouldn't be what would trouble me the most. Over the years, I developed a certain tendency when typing that slowly but surely started to turn into pain into my left wrist. For more information on that, check the first post on the series.

I kind of expected it to dissappear completely after using the keyboard for a few days, but the opposite became true: it started to hurt more actually. How was that possible? 
Well, let me tell you, I didn't know how to type correctly. On week three I started practising on [keybr](keybr.com), which is a free tutor that teaches proper typing techniques, or at least the very basics. Since I hadn't taken a typing lesson ever in my life, it quickly became evident that I didn't know shit.

That was two weeks ago. At first, I typed frustratingly slow, but I practised every day for like 30 minutes (more if possible) until I started to notice my speed picking back up and even surpassing how it was before!

Right now my speed record on [monkeytype](monkeytype.com) is 80 wpm with a 96% accuracy if I'm not mistaken. I can't remember how fast I typed switching to this keyboard, but I'm pretty sure it was a bit slower than right now, so win win.

Now that I type as intended, I type *faster* and without pains. Wowee!

### How the hell did that happen

Well, it seems simple enough if you think about it: in your arm, you have (hopefully) an elbow, a wrist, and a way to move the finger up and down and a bit to the sides. Say that before I used 3 fingers (thumb, index and *fuck you* fingers), to reach say "A", I didn't have to do much work because it was right there, but to type "b", I had to pivot the elbow, maybe the wrist and press down with the finger (no lateral or vertical movement). Enter parallelism: I now have _**FOUR**_ full fingers that only have to move up and down (maybe laterally) with (close to) zero wrist or elbow pivoting and thus, no pain!!!

## How things are stacking right now

Well, on Monday I start at a new (or rather old) job position, and it will likely result in some changes to my layout. Some shortcuts here and there and maybe something else, but I don't expect much else.

I said *close to* zero wrist movement a moment ago. That's because I'm still getting there! My left arm rests nicely at the moment, but the right one refuses to stay put. Maybe I have to do something with the shortcuts to reduce that...

## Conclusion

Since this is likely the last post on the Moonlander until something worth saying happens, here is a list of bullet points of the good and the bad:

### The GOOD:

* No pain
* I type faster
* Programmable keyboards are KING
* Autoshift to revive my pinky from the depths of hell
* Columnar layout is how it's supposed to be and I won't back down from this hill
* The thumb cluster is really nice
* I can move the keyboard around and set it however I like it for each hand independently
* Tilt adjustments (still have to really get into this)
* Everyone at work tells me to unleash the mothership when I enter the office :)
* Nobody else can simply take it and use it

### The bad

* I can't use a regular keyboard anymore
* It took a lot of effort to get here
* Not that cheap
* Portable but still a bit heavy
* Autoshift doesn't work all that nicely with keyboard shortcuts
* IDK

So yeah, the pros outweigh the cons. If you are considering the purchase, take a look at my other posts and if you still have questions, write me an email or something (you can figure it out).
