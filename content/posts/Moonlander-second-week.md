After last week's post I have to say that the wrist pain has decreased quite a bit. I'm able to lift some weights an all!

However, I have realized something else:

## Typing correctly is fucking hard

I have never ever taken typing lessons. I learned to use a keyboard on my own when I was a kid and never thought I needed it. I basically only used two or three fingers per hand (aside from the thumbs for the spacebar). Turns out, that's not all there is to it: you are supposed to use all five fingers on each hand. By doing that, you increase parallelism and (supposedly) you type faster.

## Where the Moonlander lands

As you may know, the Moonlander is a ortholinear keyboard. This means that the keys are set in columns so that each finger only has to move up and down, not sideways.

Since I'm self-teaching typing, this comes in really handy and I'm getting on with it just about fine at the moment. Just having to move the fingers up and down (besides the index and maybe the pinkys) makes it much easier to learn.

About the pinkies though, I'm still using a layout similar to the one discussed on my previous post, so the left one now only does Q, A and Z, Tab, and Esc (maybe Word Caps Lock as well).

Tildes in Spanish are a bit of a challenge at the moment, but I'm getting there.

## Conclusion

Learn to use the tools you use to work correctly.
