Hey! I'm Oscar, a computer engineer based on a small town near Madrid who enjoys tinkering with stuff. This includes computers, old consoles, electronics, etc. I also love self hosting stuff if possible, Linux and FOSS.

This blog is a place where I will put my (informal) thoughts on stuff I find interesting enough to be online for everyone to see or things I think could help others.

Feel free to lurk around the page. If you want to give your input on anything posted here you can to make a PR so we can discuss it.
