# On Rust

## C

Rust has quickly become one of my favourite programming languages to use. Even though I have not used it at work or at any serious projects yet I have finished a few online courses on it and I must say I'm quite impressed.

In University we mainly used two programming languages: Java and C. I personally think that C should be number one since my degree focused on the hardware side of things, but I digress. I fondly remember my first programming steps with C. The teacher was one of the best I ever had and made my interesting in the low-level side of computing grow quite a bit.

Since then and throughout University we used C in both of our Operating Systems classes and when studying Embedded Systems and Robotics and even though I didn't use it all that much outside those courses, I had a soft spot for it.

After finishing University I haven't had the chance to use it at all and I would have to re-learn many things about it. This is where Rust comes into play.

## Rusty memories

As I mentioned briefly, I have finished a couple of courses on Rust recently (see my Linkdin if you are interested) and I enjoyed the process of learning something new, but also the flashbacks I got from back when I used C. It was a very "hands on" experience: learning about borrowing and lifetimes and why they were needed, fighting with the compiler and reducing my time debugging runtime errors (I'm looking at you, Python). It felt great.


## Rusty future

I can't of course predict the future so I can't tell you what I will do next week, but I want to keep on learning this language on my free time. I have started "100-exercises-to-learn-rust", even though they seem to be pretty simple. The last couple of modules however... They are looking interesting indeed. After that, who knows. Maybe I will try to write some dumb terminal app or something with GTK4, but I should keep at it to not forget anything I have learned so far. I will try to update this blog once I have something interesting to say.
