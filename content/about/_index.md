Hey! I'm Oscar, a computer engineer based on a small town near Madrid who enjoys tinkering with stuff. This includes computers, old consoles, electronics, etc. 

This blog is a place where I will put my thoughts on stuff I find interesting enough to be online for everyone to see or things I think could help others.
